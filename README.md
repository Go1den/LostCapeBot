# LostCapeBot
LostCapeBot is a Twitch chat bot designed to have flexibility with modules like Pastebin, Twitter, and Mario Maker.

You will need to update the following settings files with your own information in order to get the bot working:

connectionSettings.txt

pastebinSettings.txt

twitterSettings.txt

I have very thoroughly detailed the steps necessary to get the bot running in each of these txt files. Please read them carefully.
